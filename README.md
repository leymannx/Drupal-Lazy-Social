# Lazy Social

This is a custom Drupal 7 module to attach social network buttons with counters (Like, Tweet, +1) to selected content types and selected view modes. To improve page loading speed the scripts are loaded only after a certain DOM element is visible on the screen.

### Installation
* Download & unzip
* or clone
* Enable

### Configuration
Go to admin/config/services/lazy_social and select social networks, node types and view modes.

### TO DO
* build tabs on settings page
* validate optional values
* add option to choose button types (without counter, big, small, ...)
